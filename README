>This is a fork of jweather (https://github.com/arimus/jweather). 

This fork mostly contains a simpler dependency graph with no oro or apache commons http client or any external jar. 
All features in the original project that had such dependencies are rewritten to be run with plain java 1.6.
Quite possibly we'll rewrite the whole thing and release a new one - but this is LGPL so here are my current modification published :)

jWeather is a Java library for parsing raw weather data (e.g. METAR, TAF).
Initially it will focus on parsing and providing an API for access to METAR
data, but may grow to include access to multiple reporting formats.

Please see LICENSE in this directory for jWeather licensing information.  

Thanks to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for the work they
have done to provide this data to the public.  More information regarding
weather data and the NOAA can be found at http://www.noaa.gov/

Information regarding METAR specification can be found at
http://www.ofcm.gov/fmh-1/fmh1.htm

Information regarding the TAF specification can be found at
http://metar.noaa.gov/table_master.jsp?sub_menu=yes&dir=./rel_docs/wsom/d31/&show=d31links.htm&title=title_related_docs

** NOTE **
This API absolutely will change until there is a stable release! Relying on it
to not change is probably NOT a safe bet.  It is an initial release, given as a
(hopefully) better than nothing option.  The plan is for this library to become
much cleaner and well-architected, but only time will tell.  The more you show
interest in this library/nudge me, the more likely that will be the case.
Comments and feedback greatly welcome.


Requirements:
  Java 2 SDK 1.6
  maven 3

Building:
  type 'mvn clean package'

  should have your jar file in ./target

Testing:
  optionally change the station id in the build.xml file.  To do this, change
  the argument specified for 'test' target to a valid station id (see
  stations.txt for a list of valid stations).

  Log4j setting must be provided by user

  with any luck, you should now be seeing parsed weather data
